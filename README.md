# Welcome to My Backend Yelp

A cloud-based application for restaurant reviews, powered by AWS Amplify, GraphQL API, and JavaScript.

***

## Task
The task was to deploy an existing restaurant review app (Yelp-like) to the cloud, integrating authentication and a GraphQL API to ensure a smooth user experience. The challenge involved adapting the application for seamless deployment using AWS Amplify, while ensuring secure authentication and efficient data handling with GraphQL.

## Description
To meet the challenge, I utilized **AWS Amplify** for hosting the app, integrated **Cognito** for user authentication, and connected the app to a **GraphQL API** for efficient data retrieval and management. The app, originally written in JavaScript, was deployed successfully with all necessary cloud features like authentication and API management fully functional.

## Installation
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://git.us.qwasar.io/my_backend_yelp_170004_dyky4h/my_backend_yelp.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd my_backend_yelp
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```
- Note: **--legacy-peer-deps** flag tells npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts and install the packages as they are, without enforcing strict peer dependency resolution rules.


4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage
Once deployed or running locally, the app provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and reviewing restaurants. Features include authentication and data management via GraphQL.

- To run the app locally, use the following command:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

- Navigate to your browser:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

- Authentication is required to access full functionality (sign-up, log in, and review restaurants).

## Deployment
This app is deployed using AWS Amplify. You can access the live version here:
